## Introduction
This repository outlines a comprehensive learning path for programming basics. Whether you're a beginner or looking to solidify your foundation, this guide will help you navigate through key programming concepts.

## Learning Path
1. Programming Fundamentals
2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
3. Data Structures
4. Algorithms
5. Databases
6. Networking
7. Operating Systems

## Resources

### 1. Programming Fundamentals
Start your journey with C++, an excellent language for learning core programming concepts.

### 2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
OOP is crucial for designing clear, flexible, and maintainable code. Learn it with C#, known for its strong OOP support.

- **C# Tutorial:** [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cs/index.php)
- **OOP with C# Course:** [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WbY2Doyapd6FJmM1-vU7A-0VutZMluS-?usp=sharing)

#### Practice Projects on OOP
Apply your OOP skills with these hands-on projects:
- **CRUD Project:** [YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoRh0POuk1Rw-LATGAjLWQTnS2jknpjZu)  
  Develop a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application to understand how OOP principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism are applied in real-world scenarios.

- **Educational Management System:** [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Mostafay65/Educational-Management-System-OOP-project-)  
  Build an educational management system to implement more complex OOP concepts, including advanced class hierarchies, interfaces, and design patterns.

- **Additional OOP Projects:** [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1G523fKsRp6bNCzt_005c7vBHe7Ni5Mt1)  
  Explore a variety of additional OOP projects to further practice and refine your understanding of object-oriented design and implementation.

### 3. Data Structures
Understanding data structures is key to writing efficient code. Learn them using C++ to also grasp concepts like pointers.
- Data Structures in C++ by mega code "only linear DSA" very recommended: [YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsGJzJ8SQXTcsXRVviurGei0lf_t_I4D8)
- Linear Data Structures by Adel Nasim: [YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCInYL3l2AajqOUW_2SwjWeMwf4vL4RSp)

### 4. Algorithms
Algorithms are the problem-solving strategies of programming. These courses will help you think like a programmer.
- Algorithms by Adel Nasim: [YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCInYL3l2AajqOUW_2SwjWeMwf4vL4RSp)
- Abdul Bari's Algorithm Course: [YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDN4rrl48XKpZkf03iYFl-O29szjTrs_O)

### 5. Databases
Learn both SQL and NoSQL databases to handle various data storage needs.
- SQL Server Database: [YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoRh0POuk1Rw-BZU-DPI6cA_c5W9_2uF_)
- NoSQL - MongoDB: [YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLesfn4TAj57XGGSmVzzpxY69-lha1EWEI)

### 6. Networking
Understanding networking is crucial in our interconnected world of software.
- Networking Course by Mohab Alaa: [YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQXgDrsmqpLwULiDPr_4iWHMmKhzbQamj)

### 7. Operating Systems
Grasp how software interacts with hardware through operating systems.

## Additional Tips
- Consistency is key. Try to code a little every day to build and maintain your skills.
- Don't Ÿêjust watch videos - code along and experiment with the concepts you learn.
- Join coding communities or find a study buddy to share your learning journey.
- Work on personal projects to apply your knowledge in real-world scenarios.
- Remember, debugging is a crucial skill. Embrace errors as learning opportunities.

## Next Steps
After mastering these basics, consider exploring:
- Web development (Frontend or backend or both)
- Mobile app development
- Cloud computing
- Machine Learning and AI
- etc...

Remember, the field of programming is vast and ever-evolving. Stay curious and keep learning!

Happy coding!
